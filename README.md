# Python Chess Project

This is a chess project I developed during my A-Levels. While the game is functional in its basic mechanics, some features such as **AI mode** and the **statistics panel** remain incomplete due to time constraints during the project.

> **Note:** The `Details.txt` file and the `design` folder (with all its contents) must be present in the directory for the program to run correctly.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. On the main game screen:
   - White moves first.
   - Click on a piece of your colour, then click the target square.
   - If the move is valid, the piece will relocate, and it will be the opponentâ€™s turn.
3. Continue taking turns until the game ends according to standard chess rules.
